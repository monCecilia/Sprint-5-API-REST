# Sprint-5-API-REST
## Description

### Level 1

As you may have learned, there are numerous platforms that provide an API for you to consume your data.
These APIs can be free or paid, open, or require an API key.
We will create a joke website, consuming data from a free API that requires no key. You will see that it is very fun and interesting to be able to get data from an API, imagine how many websites you can make!

- Header to obtain the data in the format that interests us:
```'Accept': 'application / json'
```

### Level 2
Consume a weather information API and display it on the web. This API should be told in the opening, not by a button.

### Level 3
Layout the website of jokes and weather.
